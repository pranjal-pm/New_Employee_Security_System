# New_Employee_Security_System
This project implements a contactless employee check-in system using smartphone sensor data. Instead of traditional keycards, employees are identified automatically through gait analysis: the system analyzes accelerometer data from the employeeâ€™s smartphone to recognize their walking pattern and grants access.
